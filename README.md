# Predictive Modeling of Heating and Cooling Loads (Coming Soon! ðŸš§)

This project will denote parameters such as glazing area, orientation, etc., as (Xi), and targets such as heating load and cooling load as (Yi). Below shows the notation we will be using:

| Name | Role   | Description               |
|------|--------|---------------------------|
| X1   | Feature| Relative Compactness      |
| X2   | Feature| Surface Area              |
| X3   | Feature| Wall Area                 |
| X4   | Feature| Roof Area                 |
| X5   | Feature| Overall Height            |
| X6   | Feature| Orientation               |
| X7   | Feature| Glazing Area              |
| X8   | Feature| Glazing Area Distribution |
| Y1   | Target | Heating Load              |
| Y2   | Target | Cooling Load              |

# Regression model 
The equation for multi-dimensional (or multiple) linear regression can be written as:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \dots + \beta_n x_n + \epsilon
$$

Where:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $\( y \)$ is the dependent variable (target),
  \item $\( \beta_0 \)$ is the intercept,
  \item $\( \beta_1, \beta_2, \dots, \beta_n \)$ are the regression coefficients (weights) for the independent variables,
  \item $\( x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \)$ are the independent variables (features) such as Relative Compactness, Surface Area, Wall Area
  \item $\( \epsilon \)$ is the error term (residuals).
\end{itemize}
