# Predictive Modeling of Heating and Cooling Loads 

This project will denote parameters such as glazing area, orientation, etc., as (Xi), and targets such as heating load and cooling load as (Yi). Below shows the notation we will be using:

| Name | Role   | Description               |
|------|--------|---------------------------|
| X1   | Feature| Relative Compactness      |
| X2   | Feature| Surface Area              |
| X3   | Feature| Wall Area                 |
| X4   | Feature| Roof Area                 |
| X5   | Feature| Overall Height            |
| X6   | Feature| Orientation               |
| X7   | Feature| Glazing Area              |
| X8   | Feature| Glazing Area Distribution |
| Y1   | Target | Heating Load              |
| Y2   | Target | Cooling Load              |
